Dear Sir,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to summarize the work completed today on the Swiss Cottages AI chatbot project.

## Work Summary - February 12, 2026

### Main Focus: Location Answer Improvements

Today I worked on enhancing the chatbot's location response quality by improving the prompt templates and answer validation.

### Work Completed

**1. Enhanced Location Prompts (chatbot/bot/client/prompt.py)**

- Strengthened the location prompt template with clearer instructions
- Added explicit format requirements for location answers
- Improved guidance to ensure consistent and accurate location responses

**2. Improved Answer Validation (chatbot/api/main.py)**

- Enhanced the answer validation function to ensure location responses meet quality standards
- Added checks to maintain consistency in location descriptions

### Files Modified

1. `chatbot/bot/client/prompt.py` - Enhanced location prompt template
2. `chatbot/api/main.py` - Improved answer validation

### Testing

Verified the improvements with various test cases including:
- Direct location queries
- Location queries in different conversation contexts
- Sequential location queries

The chatbot now provides more consistent and accurate location information.

### Next Steps

- Continue monitoring and fine-tuning the location responses
- Further optimize prompts based on usage patterns

I am available for any questions or clarifications regarding today's work.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
