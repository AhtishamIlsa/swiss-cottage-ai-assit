Question: How is the view from the cottages?

Answer: The views from the cottages vary depending on the cottage number, room location, and floor level. Guests can enjoy mountain views, valley views, and lush greenery across the property. Some rooms on the ground floor or basement level offer pleasant greenery or surrounding views rather than open valley views. Cottage 7 is a corner unit and is unique in that it offers dual-sided views, allowing guests to enjoy both mountain and valley views from different sides of the cottage. Overall, every cottage provides a scenic and peaceful environment, with views differing slightly by room and layout.
