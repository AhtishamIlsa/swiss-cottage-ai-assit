Question: How do you ensure privacy and cleanliness?

Answer: Swiss Cottages is a privately owned property where privacy, cleanliness, and top-quality service are given the highest priority. Each booking is for an entire private cottage, and thorough cleaning is done before every guest stay to maintain high standards.
