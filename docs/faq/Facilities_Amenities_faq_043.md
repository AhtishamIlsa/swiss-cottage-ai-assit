Question: What is the maximum number of guests that can be accommodated for corporate or group bookings?

Answer: For corporate events or large group stays, Swiss Cottages can accommodate guests across up to 7 cottages within the same neighborhood, subject to availability. This setup allows large teams or corporate groups to stay close together while maintaining comfort, privacy, and a peaceful environment. Guests are accommodated across multiple cottages rather than a single unit, making it ideal for retreats, off-site meetings, or group getaways.
