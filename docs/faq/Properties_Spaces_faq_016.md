Question: Can you tell me about Cottage 7?

Answer: Cottage 7 is a charming two-bedroom corner cottage that offers enhanced privacy and exceptional dual-sided panoramic views of both the mountains and lush garden surroundings. Its corner positioning allows more natural light and wider views compared to standard cottages. The ground floor, conveniently accessible from the car parking level, features a spacious, sunlit lounge with large windows, a modern open kitchen, and a dining area, all designed to make the most of the scenic surroundings. A well-appointed bathroom is also located on this level for added convenience. The lower floor hosts two beautifully designed bedrooms, each with dual-aspect windows that bring in abundant natural light. One bedroom includes a private en-suite bathroom, while the second bedroom uses a bathroom located just outside the room, ensuring comfort and practicality for families or small groups.
