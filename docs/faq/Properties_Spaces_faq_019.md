Question: Can larger groups or corporate teams stay at Swiss Cottages

Answer: Yes, corporate trips and larger groups are welcome, however they must book multiple cottages based on the total number of guests. For such bookings, guests are required to contact the manager directly so availability, cottage allocation, and pricing can be arranged properly.
