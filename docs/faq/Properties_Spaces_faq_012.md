Question: Describe Cottage 7

Answer: Cottage 7 is a charming two-bedroom corner cottage that offers enhanced privacy and exceptional dual-sided panoramic views of both the mountains and lush garden surroundings. Its corner positioning makes it one of the most scenic cottages in the community. The ground floor, easily accessible from the car parking level, features a spacious and sunlit lounge with large windows, a modern open kitchen, and a dining area, all designed to maximize natural light and views. A well-appointed bathroom is also located on this level for added convenience. The lower floor includes two beautifully designed bedrooms, each with dual-aspect windows that allow abundant natural light. One bedroom has a private en-suite bathroom, while the second bedroom uses a bathroom located just outside the room, ensuring comfort and practicality for families or groups.
